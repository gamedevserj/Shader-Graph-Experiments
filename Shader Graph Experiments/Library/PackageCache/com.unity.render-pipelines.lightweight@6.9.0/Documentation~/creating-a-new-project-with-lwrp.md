# Using LWRP in a new Project

If you want to use the Lightweight Render Pipeline in a new Project, you can create a new Project using Templates.

To create a Project using Templates:

1. Open Unity. On the Home page, click __New__ to start a new Project. Under __Template__, select the Lightweight Render Pipeline template.
2. Click __Create Project__. Unity automatically creates a new Project for you, complete with all the LWRP functions.

For more information on using Templates, see [Project Templates](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ProjectTemplates.html) in the Unity Manual.

**Note:** Before you can start using LWRP, you must configure it by creating a Scriptable Render Pipeline Asset and changing your Graphics settings. To learn how, see [Configuring LWRP for use](configuring-lwrp-for-use.md).
