## Description

The **Blackboard** defines the [Properties](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-Properties.html) that will be exposed to materials using the shader. Here you can define a range of [Property](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-Properties.html) types as well as their various names, attributes and default values.

You can also rename the [Shader Graph Asset](Shader-Graph-Asset.md) and change its path in the shader dropdown list by selecting their fields in the **Blackboard**'s title bar. When editing a [Sub-graph](Sub-graph.md) the path field will set the [Sub-graph's](Sub-graph.md) path in the [Create Node Menu](Create-Node-Menu.md).

The **Blackboard** can be moved to anywhere in the [Shader Graph Window](Shader-Graph-Window.md) and will automatically move with the nearest corner of that window.

To create a new [Property](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-Properties.html), click the *Add* button on the **Blackboard** title bar and select the [Property](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-Properties.html) type.

[Properties](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-Properties.html) on the **Blackboard** can be reordered by dragging them in the list. They can be deleted with Delete (Windows) or Command + Backpace (OSX). You can rename a [Property](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-Properties.html) by double clicking on its entry. Instances of a [Property](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-Properties.html) can be created in the shader by dragging them on to the **Graph**.

For a full list of [Property](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-Properties.html) types see [Property Types](Property-Types.md).
